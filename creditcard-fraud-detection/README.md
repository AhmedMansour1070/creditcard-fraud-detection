##  Dataset

- Based on the [Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)
- Features are anonymized via PCA (V1â€“V28) plus `Time`, `Amount`, and `Class`

> The dataset is not included due to size/privacy. Download from Kaggle and place in `src/data/`.

##  Models Used

- Decision Tree
- Random Forest (Top Features)
- Random Forest with SMOTE
- Undersampling
- Feature Engineering Pipeline

##  Features

- Custom plot saving to `eda_plots/` and `model_plots/`
- Leveneâ€™s and KS statistical tests for feature selection
- Modularized pipeline for flexibility
- Configurable via `main.py`

## How to Run

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

Edit `main.py` to:
- Run only selected models
- Toggle EDA or statistical tests

## Requirements

Python 3.8+ and the following libraries:
- pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn
- scikit-learn, imbalanced-learn
